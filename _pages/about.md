<p style="text-align: justify">Hi, Welcome to my home page! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I'm a MSc holder who interested in machine learning and its applications. Although I graduated from the university, I'm still looking for research opportunities in the area of machine learning. Recently, I was research assistant under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://en.irandoc.ac.ir/u/a-fakhrzadeh">Azadeh Fakhrzadeh</a> at <a href="https://en.irandoc.ac.ir/">Iranian Research Institute for Information Science and Technology</a>, where I worked on a research project related to digital pathology and image segmentation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I received my Master's degree in health systems engineering from <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en">Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)</a>, where I also received my B.Sc. in Industrial engineering. During my M.Sc., I mainly focused on machine learning and its application in healthcare. I've done my thesis under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2019/ABBAS%20AHMADI">Abbas Ahmadi</a> and Prof. <a href="https://en.irandoc.ac.ir/u/a-jalalimanesh">Ammar Jalalimanesh</a> in the area of human pose estimation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>research interests</strong>  I'm interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, especially computer vision problems like human pose estimation and medical imaging. Also, optimization problems in the field of machine learning are interesting for me and related to my mathematical background. I'm open for collaborating on machine learning research projects. feel free to drop me an email.</p>
