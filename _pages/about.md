<p style="text-align: justify">Hi, Welcome to my home page! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I'm a computer science PhD student at Sate University of New York at Buffalo (UB) under supervision of Prof. <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~mgao8/">Mingchen Gao</a>. Previously, I was research assistant under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://en.irandoc.ac.ir/u/a-fakhrzadeh">Azadeh Fakhrzadeh</a> at <a href="https://en.irandoc.ac.ir/">Iranian Research Institute for Information Science and Technology</a>, where I worked on a research project related to digital pathology and image segmentation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I received my Master's degree in health systems engineering from <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en">Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)</a>, where I also received my B.Sc. in Industrial engineering. During my M.Sc., I mainly focused on machine learning and its application in healthcare. I've done my thesis under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2019/ABBAS%20AHMADI">Abbas Ahmadi</a> and Prof. <a href="https://en.irandoc.ac.ir/u/a-jalalimanesh">Ammar Jalalimanesh</a> in the area of human pose estimation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>research interests</strong>  I'm interested in trustworthy machine learning, especially in the area of computer vision. More specifically, I enjoy working on problems like continual learning and unsupervised domain adaptation in computer vision applications. I'm open for collaborating on machine learning research projects. feel free to drop me an email.</p>
