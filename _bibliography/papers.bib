  abstract={As life expectancy increases in the world, the number of elderly people will increase in the coming years. With the increase in the number of elderly people and the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, hospitals will no longer have the capacity to care for elderly patients for a long time and will inevitably have to turn to home health care. One of home health care items is to check and monitor physical activities such as physiotherapy exercises. Human pose estimation models in the field of computer vision can solve this problem well. In this study, a new 2D multi-person pose estimation model is introduced that can be used in elderly care. This bottom-up model includes a backbone network called Res2net to extract features and composite fields to estimate key points and connections. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed model outperforms previous similar models in both performance and reliability in low resolution. Proposed model has suitable speed for real-time operation too and qualitative results showed that it is a practical model for elderly care.},
